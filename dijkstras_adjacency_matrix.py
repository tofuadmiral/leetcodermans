    '''
    In this algorithm, we're trying to find the shortest distance
    between two nodes on a graph. This is a directed graph represented
    as an adjacency matrix. I'm assumming all weights are positive. 

    The algorithm is essentially:
        - mark all tentative distances as infinity, except where we start (which is 0)
        - make sure to keep track of visited and unvisited nodes
        - calculate actual distance, and if actual distance is < tentative, 
          replace the tentative distance with the actual distance
        - move to the next node that is the least distance from start, 
          and is also unvisited
        - stop once we're at the target node, then break and just return
          what the tentative distance to that node was, since it's the shortest path
